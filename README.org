* Academic Website Template
  This template was designed to provide an easy way to create academic 
  websites. The goal is to lower the barrier to create webpages
  for scholars with limited knowledge about programming.

  This is achieved by separating content from form. This way you can simply
  add your content and everything else is done for you. This template is
  heavily influenced by [[https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io][Academic pages]] and [[https://www.simonho.ca/][Simon Ho's website]].

  This website template is created with [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] - a static site generator -
  and uses the [[https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/][minimal mistakes theme]]. The template was created so that 
  it's easy to deyloy to [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Pages]], but you can make simple
  modifications to deploy it on other services (see the [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/][Jekyll documentation]]).

* Building your website
  1. Create your own copy of this website by [[https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/][forking]] this GitHub repo
  3. [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-your-subscriptions#unwatch-a-repository][Unwatch]] the repo
  4. [[https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/renaming-a-repository][Rename the repo]] to <username>.github.io ([[https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-a-repository-for-your-site][see step 3 of this guide]])
  4. Your website should be live at
     [[https://][https://<username>.github.io/]] ([[https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-a-repository-for-your-site][see step 7 of this guide]])

* Modifying the website
** Important note
   There are two ways to modify your website. I will discuss them very
   briefly [[file:docs/how-to-modify-website.md][here]] to help you make your decision. 
** Adding the website's basic information
   This information is configured in
   the =_config.yml= file. Here you can add information like the website's name,
   your name, links to your research platforms, and many other information. 
   Explore the different options to find everything that can be modified.
   
** Adding content
   Most pages incorporate their content from two sources: the actual 
   file (e.g., =Research.md=) and the =yaml= file with the same name that 
   can be found in the =_data= directory. 

   This helps facilitate the process of adding new information because
   the =yaml= files are very easy and intuitive to use, even if you don't know
   any programming. These files follow a /bullet/ or outline format and just
   require you to /list/ the contents you want displayed in the page.

   For example, the Research page presents all the information that you include
   in the =Research.md= file and then it includes the research projects
   you have listed in the =research.yml= file. This makes it easier to 
   continually add new research projects in the =yaml= file and keep your 
   webpage updated.

   Below you will find a description of how to modify your website. If you
   prefer a more detailed version of this documentation please refer to
   the [[file:docs/add-content-long-version.md][long version of this documentation]].

**** Add content to existing pages
      The Research, Publications, Talks, and Software pages get their contents from
      their =markdown= and associated =yaml= file. So you have to modify
      both files.

**** Featured rows
     The Home and Research pages contain a feature row to highlight your
     interests. To modify these rows, you have to provide the required
     information in each page. You can check the [[https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#feature-row][theme's webpage]]
     for more details.

**** Add and remove pages
     Just create a =markdown= file in the =_pages= directory, add the
     metadata, and content. You also have to modify the =navigation.yml= 
     file.
     
     To remove pages, just delete the page from the =_pages= directory and
     delete the entry from the =navigation.yml=.

**** Adding files for download
     Add the files you need to be available in the website (e.g., CV, pdf
     for downloading) in the =downloads= directory.

**** Blog
     To modify the blog's home page, just add your content to the =blog.md=
     file in =_pages=.
      
     Blog posts are in the =_posts= directory. You can remove the ones
     that are there for illustration purposes. They are all from the 
     minimal mistakes theme project template.

     To add new blog posts, just create a new =markdown= file that meets the
     name and metadata requirements and add your content. See the [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/][Jekyll's]] 
     webpage for more details.

** Further customization
   The website has many more features. Please read
   [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/][Jekyll's]] and [[https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/][minimal mistakes theme]] documentation for 
   learning how to modify how the website looks and how it's structured.
* Contributing to this project
  All contributions are welcome!

  You can help out by writing documentation or tutorials on how to modify
  certain things, report bugs or errors in code or documentation, fixing bugs,
  or by providing ideas. This is a beginner friendly project!

  You are welcome to communicate any errors by [[https://github.com/mario-bermonti/academic-website-template/issues][submitting an
  issue]] on Github.

  To fix bugs, clone the repository, add your contribution, 
  and submit a [[https://github.com/mario-bermonti/academic-website-template/pulls][pull request]].

  If have suggestions on how to improve the website design (e.g., default
  tabs, theme, etc.), please open an [[https://github.com/mario-bermonti/academic-website-template/issues][issue on Github]] or [[mailto:mbermonti1132@gmail.com][email me]]. Please
  keep in mind that the template should be general enough so that any features
  work for most people, so only suggestions that will benefit most people will be
  incorporated.
