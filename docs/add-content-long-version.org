* Academic Website Template
** Adding content to your website
   This is a detailed version of how to add content to your site. It has all
   the details about managing your website and should get you through,
   even if you don't know anything about programming.

**** Add content to existing pages
***** Regular content
     You can find the current pages in the =_pages= directory. To add new content,
     just write it in the file and save it. Also modify the page's metadata
     at the top of the page if you need to.
    
     If you would like to change the name of the page in the menu bar, you 
     have to modify it in the =navigation.yml= file that is in the =_data= directory.
***** Yaml content
      The Research, Publications, Talks, and Software pages list the relevant 
      information by collecting it from its associated =yaml= file. These
      files are located in the =_data= directory and have the same name
      as the page (e.g., Research).
     
      To modify its content, just substitute the current information
      with your information. Keep the "" if there are any. Optional 
      fields are identified with comments.
     
***** Featured rows
     The home and research pages contain a feature row to highlight your
     interests. To modify these rows, you have to provide the required
     information in each page. You can check the [[https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#feature-row][theme's webpage]]
     for more details.

**** Add new pages
     - Create a =markdown= file in the =_pages= directory and add the content.
     - Add metadata at the top of the file
       Hint: create a copy of an existing page and add the new content
     - Add the page to the menu bar, by adding it to the =navigation.yml= 
       file. Follow the format of other entries and add the name of the tab
       and add where the file will be saved to (permalink). If no permalink is
       specified then it should just be the name of the file.

**** Remove existing pages
     - Delete the page from the =_pages= directory
     - Delete the entry from the =navigation.yml=

**** Adding files for download
      Add the files you need to be available in the website (e.g., CV, pdf
      for downloading) in the =downloads= directory.

**** Creating blog posts
***** Blog's home page
      To modify the blog's home page, just add your content to the =blog.md=
      file in =_pages=.

      Hint: If you only want the blog and are not interested in the complete 
            website, you will have to remove all other pages and set the
            blog's home as the website's homepage.
***** Blog posts
     Blog posts are in the =_posts= directory. You can remove the ones
     that are there for illustration purposes. They are all from the 
     minimal mistakes theme project template.

     To add new blog posts, just create a new =markdown= file that meets the
     name and metadata requirements and add your content. See the [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/][Jekyll's]] 
     webpage for more details.

** Further customization
   The website has many more features. Please read [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/][Jekyll's]] and
   [[https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/][minimal mistakes theme]] documentation for learning how to modify
   how the website looks and how it's structured.
