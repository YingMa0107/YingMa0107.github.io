  description: By using a simple family of ODEs informed by the biochemistry of gene expression to constrain the likelihood of a deep generative model, we can simultaneously infer the latent time and latent state of each cell and predict its future gene expression state. The model can be interpreted as a mixture of ODEs whose parameters vary continuously across a latent space of cell states.

To address this limitation, we derive a novel nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm for integrating single-cell datasets containing both shared and unshared features.

  description: Using LIGER and Topologizer, we assemble an atlas of cell states from 61,977 individual non-CM scRNA-seq profiles isolated at multiple time points during regeneration. This analysis reveals extensive non-CM cell diversity and suggests an important role for MC in inducing the activated FB and EC subpopulations. Furthermore, map the topological relationships and dynamic transitions between functional states. Our analysis provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of cardiac regeneration.

  image: pub4.gif
  description: Bone marrow houses a multifunctional stromal cell population expressing C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), termed CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells, that regulates osteogenesis and adipogenesis. The quiescent pre-adipocyte-like subset of CXCL12+ stromal cells (“Adipo-CAR” cells) is localized to sinusoidal surfaces and particularly enriched for hematopoiesis-supporting cytokines. However, detailed characteristics of these CXCL12+ pre-adipocyte-like stromal cells and how they contribute to marrow adipogenesis remain largely unknown. Here we highlight CXCL12-dependent physical coupling with hematopoietic cells as a potential mechanism regulating the adipogenic potential of CXCL12+ stromal cells.

Iterative data addition can also be used to map new data to a reference dataset.
