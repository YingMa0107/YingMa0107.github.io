I am an incoming Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/home">Department of Biostatistics</a> and as a member at the <a href="https://ccmb.brown.edu">Center for Computational Molecular Biology</a> at Brown University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Biostatistics at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in June 2023. I have been working with <a href="https://www.xzlab.org">Dr. Xiang Zhou</a> on developing statistical and computational methods for genomics and genetics data. My recent research interests focus on developing efficient statistical learning methods to address a variety of biological problems and computational challenges in genomics and genetics, particularly single-cell RNA-sequencing, and spatially resolved transcriptomics. In addition to my methodological research, I also work on genetic risk prediction analysis for common health exposure traits in large biobanks such as UK Biobank, and the <a href="https://precisionhealth.umich.edu/our-research/michigangenomics/">Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI)</a>.

Research Interests
======
<p style="text-align: justify">
My research interests focus on developing efficient statistical learning methods to address a variety of biological problems and computational challenges in genomics and genetics. These challenges typically arise with the high-dimensional data generated by rapidly evolving sequencing technologies, e.g., single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT). With the emergence of these large-scale data, I have been continually motivated to develop tailored statistical models to advance our understanding in cellular heterogeneity, tissue organization, and the underlying mechanisms of various types of cancers. In particular, my work centers on these important areas: (1) Powerful integrative statistical tests of association between gene sets and a phenotype; (2) Scalable Bayesian models and computational tools for high-throughput genomics data (3) Effective and efficient optimization algorithms for multi-omics integrative analysis; (3) Genetic risk prediction analysis in large-scale bio-banks.

<p style="text-align: justify">
We have openings for multiple positions, including Postdoctoral Fellow, and PhD Student. We are seeking applications for a postdoctoral fellow position within our research group. This position emphasize developing statistical methods and computational tools in high-dimensional biological data from functional genomic seuqnecing studies or genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Specific areas include, but not limited to, (1) spatially resolved multi-omics data; (2) single-cell genomics; (3) genetic risk prediction; (4) integrative modeling of GWAS summary statistics and omics data. This opportunity offers competitive benefits and involves working with diverse large-scale datasets. Prospective applicants should hold or be pursuing a PhD in biostatistics, statistics, computer science, bioinformatics, computational biology, biomedical engeneering, mathematics, or a related quantitative discipline. Strong computational skills are required. Interested applicants should submit a brief statement of interest, CV, and contact information for three references. For questions regarding the position, please contact me at [yingma@umich.edu]. Applications will be reviewed promptly and accepted until the positions are filled.
