<p style="text-align: justify">
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I have been working with <a href="https://www.xzlab.org">Dr. Xiang Zhou</a> on developing statistical and computational methods for genomics and genetics data. My recent research interests focus on developing efficient statistical learning methods to address a variety of biological problems and computational challenges in genomics and genetics, particularly single-cell RNA-sequencing, and spatially resolved transcriptomics. In addition to my methodological research, I also work on genetic risk prediction analysis for common health exposure traits in large biobanks such as UK Biobank, and the <a href="https://precisionhealth.umich.edu/our-research/michigangenomics/">Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI)</a>. I will be joining as an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/home">Department of Biostatistics</a> and as a member at the <a href="https://ccmb.brown.edu">Center for Computational Molecular Biology</a> at Brown University this summer.
