I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I have been working with [Dr. Xiang Zhou](https://www.xzlab.org) on developing statistical and computational methods for genomics and genetics data. My recent research interests focus on developing efficient statistical learning methods to address a variety of biological problems and computational challenges in genomics and genetics, particularly single-cell RNA-sequencing, and spatially resolved transcriptomics. In addition to my methodological research, I also work on genetic risk prediction analysis for common health exposure traits in large biobanks such as UK Biobank, and the [Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI)](https://precisionhealth.umich.edu/our-research/michigangenomics/). I will be joining as an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/home) and as a member at the [Center for Computational Molecular Biology](https://ccmb.brown.edu) at Brown University this summer.
